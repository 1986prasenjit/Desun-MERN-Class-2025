## 1. The Class (The Blueprint)

**The Story:**
"Imagine you want to build a magical treasure chest. Before you build it, you need a drawing or a plan, right? You need a piece of paper that says: 'This chest will have a lock, a lid, and space for gold.' This drawing isn't the chest itself; you can't put gold in the drawing. It’s just the plan."

**Definition:**
A **Class** is the blueprint or the plan. It describes what something *looks like* and what it *does*, but it isn't the thing itself yet.

---

## 2. The Object (The Actual Chest)

**The Story:**
"Now, we take wood and nails and follow the plan. Bang, bang, bang! Now we have a real box sitting on the floor. We can touch it. We can put toys in it. This is the Object. We can follow that same plan to build five different boxes."

**Definition:**
An **Object** is the real thing created from the Class (the blueprint).

## 3. Encapsulation (The Lock and Key)

**The Story:**
"Imagine you have 100 gold coins inside your chest. Do you want just anyone to walk by, reach in, and steal them? No! You put a heavy lock on it.
If someone wants to put gold in or take gold out, they can't just reach inside. They have to ask you for the Key. The lock protects what is inside."

**Definition:**
**Encapsulation** means hiding the important data (variables) inside the class and only letting people touch it using specific tools (methods). It keeps the data safe.

## 4. Inheritance (The Pirate Chest)

**The Story:**
"Okay, we have a normal chest. But now, we want a **Pirate Chest**.
Do we have to draw the whole plan from scratch? No! We already know how to make a chest. We just take the original plan and say: 'Copy that, but add a Skull flag on top.'
The Pirate Chest 'inherits' the wood and the lock from the normal chest, but it adds its own cool stuff."

**Definition:**
**Inheritance** is when a new class (Child) gets all the features of an old class (Parent) so you don't have to write the code twice.

---

## 5. Polymorphism (The Magic Spell)

**The Story:**
"Imagine every chest has a big red button on it that says **'OPEN'**.
* When you press the button on the **Normal Chest**, it just creaks open. *Creak!*
* When you press the button on the **Pirate Chest**, it doesn't creak... it yells 'YARRR!' and shoots confetti!
It’s the same button (Open), but different chests do it differently."

**Definition:**
**Polymorphism** (Poly = Many, Morph = Forms) means using the same command (like `Open()`), but the object behaves differently depending on what type it is.

## 6. Abstraction (The Simple Lever)

**The Story:**
"Think about a video game controller. You press 'X' to jump. Do you know how the electricity inside the controller works? Do you know the computer code inside the game that calculates gravity? No. You don't need to know! You just press 'X' and it works.
We hide the complicated wires and just give you a simple button."

**Definition:**
**Abstraction** means showing only the necessary details (the button) and hiding the complex background logic (the wires) from the user.
